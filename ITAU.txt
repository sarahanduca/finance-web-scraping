ITUB or HDB: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?
Investors looking for stocks in the Banks - Foreign sector might want to consider either Banco Itau (ITUB) or HDFC Bank (HDB). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.
Banco Itau has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while HDFC Bank has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. This means that ITUB's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.
ITUB currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.04, while HDB has a forward P/E of 20.59. We also note that ITUB has a PEG ratio of 0.61. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. HDB currently has a PEG ratio of 1.34.
Another notable valuation metric for ITUB is its P/B ratio of 1.32. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, HDB has a P/B of 2.88.
Based on these metrics and many more, ITUB holds a Value grade of B, while HDB has a Value grade of C.
ITUB is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that ITUB is likely the superior value option right now.

3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Banco Itau (ITUB)
Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.
In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.
However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.
Banco Itau (ITUB) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this financial holding company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Banco Itau is 1.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 19.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 18.6%.
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.
Right now, Banco Itau has an S/TA ratio of 0.13, which means that the company gets $0.13 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.04, it can be said that the company is more efficient.
In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Banco Itau looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 11.5% this year versus the industry average of 0%.
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
The current-year earnings estimates for Banco Itau have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.4% over the past month.
Bottom Line
Banco Itau has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that Banco Itau is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

6 Reasons Why Itau Unibanco (ITUB) Stock is Worth Betting on
Itau Unibanco Holding S.A.’s ITUB financials are expected to get continuous support from a strong network franchise, strategic buyouts, solid funding base, and growth in revenues from commissions and fees. Hence, it seems to be a wise idea to invest in ITUB stock now, given its solid fundamentals and decent growth prospects.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ITUBs' earnings has been revised 1.4% and 1.3% north for 2023 and 2024, respectively, over the past 30 days. This shows that analysts are optimistic regarding the company’s earnings prospects. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
In this year so far, the stock has gained 12.5% compared with the industry's growth of 8.6%.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Mentioned below are a few factors that make ITUB a must-buy stock now.
Revenue Growth: Itau Unibanco has displayed growth in revenues from commissions and fees, and results from insurance operations. The uptrend over the years was largely due to a rise in asset management, credit operations and guarantees provided as well as credit and debit cards.
Further, given its preeminent position in the asset management and investment banking businesses in Latin America, and growth opportunities in the insurance space, the metric is likely to improve in the upcoming period. For 2023, management estimates commissions and fees, and results from insurance operations to be up 5-7%.
Solid Funding Base: ITUB has a strong funding base, evident from the deposit of R$923.28 billion as of Jun 30, 2023. Also, its times interest earned ratio of 1.4 for second-quarter 2023 has been unchanged from first-quarter 2023. Hence, we believe, it is less likely to default interest and debt repayments if the economic situation worsens.
Moreover, robust funding position of the company helps it to maintain a healthy credit portfolio (including financial guarantees provided and corporate securities). The credit portfolio has been rising over the years. Also, it has been trying to reduce its loan portfolio exposure in higher volatile segments with an aim to strengthen credit portfolio. Management anticipates its credit portfolio to improve by 6-9% in 2023.
Strong Network Franchise: As a premier banking brand in Brazil, Itau Unibanco has a large branch network, with branches concentrated in Southeast Brazil. Moreover, as part of its internationalization strategy, the company has consolidated its presence in other countries of the Southern Cone — Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay — with branches positioned in regions, where activity levels are high.
ITUB had also expanded its presence in Colombia and Panama, followed by the merger between Banco Itaú Chile and CorpBanca in April 2016.
Strategic Acquisitions: Management has been expanding operations in Brazil and abroad on the back of strategic acquisitions. In 2022, the company inked a deal to acquire Ideal Holding to bolster its investment ecosystem and completed the first phase of the deal on Mar 31, 2023.
In 2020, it concluded the first phase of acquiring a 52.96% stake in Zup IT Servicos for around R$293 million, aiding development of digital transformation projects, and offering functionalities and digital products to its customers. Thus, via such inorganic efforts to diversify its product mix, it is expected to support ITUB’s top line in the upcoming quarters.
Technological Advancements: Itau Unibanco’s ongoing investments in technology will contribute to improve processes, reduce costs and increase productivity gains. It had initiated a transformational strategy, iVarejo 2030, at its retail operations unit. It has adopted the phygital and omnichannel approach as well as the e-Commerce model to improve in-person services and revamp its branch networks.
Through these efforts, it targets to increase digital sales in the long term. The company is also modernizing its banking legacy systems and migrating services to cloud, making it more efficient and competitive in its domain.
Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Itau Unibanco has an ROE of 17.71%, higher than the industry average of 12.45%. This shows that it reinvests its cash more efficiently than its peers.
A couple of other top-ranked stocks from the finance space are Morgan Stanley MS and Tradeweb Markets Inc. TW. MS and TW currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Morgan Stanley’s current-year earnings has been unchanged. Over the past six months, the MS stock has decreased 3.2%.
Earnings estimate for TW has also been unchanged for the current year over the past 30 days. Over the past six months, TW’s shares have gained 6.9%.

Banco Itau's stock sees 17.41% year-to-date increase, dividend growth promising
The Sao Paulo-based financial institution, Banco Itau, has witnessed a significant surge in its stock price since the start of the year. As of Wednesday, the firm's stocks have risen by 17.41%. The company's current dividend yield stands at 4.09%, a figure to be compared with the foreign banks industry average of 4.61% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.7%.
Banco Itau's dividend growth has been particularly noteworthy. The financial institution's current annualized dividend is at $0.23 per share, a substantial increase of 48.4% from the previous year. Over the past five years, Banco Itau has thrice raised its dividend on a year-over-year basis, resulting in an average annual increase of 10.24%.
The payout ratio, which denotes the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share paid out as dividends, plays a pivotal role in future dividend growth along with earnings growth. For Banco Itau, the current payout ratio is at 37%, indicating that it distributed 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividends.
Looking ahead to this fiscal year, Banco Itau forecasts robust earnings growth. The consensus estimate for 2023 is $0.73 per share, which would signify a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 19.67%.
Dividends are often favored by income investors who aim to generate consistent cash flow from their liquid investments. Numerous academic studies suggest that dividends can constitute significant portions of long-term returns, often exceeding one-third of total returns.
However, it is important to note that not all companies offer a quarterly payout. Dividends can also provide various benefits such as tax advantages, reducing overall portfolio risk, and significantly enhancing stock investing profits.

Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?
Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.
Banco Itau in Focus
Banco Itau (ITUB) is headquartered in Sao Paulo, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 17.41% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.04 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 4.09%. In comparison, the Banks - Foreign industry's yield is 4.61%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.7%.
Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $0.23 is up 48.4% from last year. Banco Itau has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10.24%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Banco Itau's current payout ratio is 37%, meaning it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.
Looking at this fiscal year, ITUB expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $0.73 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 19.67%.
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.
For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that ITUB is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

ITUB vs. HDB: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?
Investors interested in stocks from the Banks - Foreign sector have probably already heard of Banco Itau (ITUB) and HDFC Bank (HDB). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Banco Itau has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while HDFC Bank has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ITUB has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.
ITUB currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.71, while HDB has a forward P/E of 22.87. We also note that ITUB has a PEG ratio of 0.67. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. HDB currently has a PEG ratio of 1.48.
Another notable valuation metric for ITUB is its P/B ratio of 1.45. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, HDB has a P/B of 3.26.
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ITUB's Value grade of B and HDB's Value grade of C.
ITUB sticks out from HDB in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ITUB is the better option right now.

Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Banco Itau (ITUB) Now
Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.
By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.
However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Banco Itau (ITUB) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this financial holding company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Banco Itau is 1.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 19.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 17.6%.
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.
Right now, Banco Itau has an S/TA ratio of 0.13, which means that the company gets $0.13 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.04, it can be said that the company is more efficient.
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Banco Itau is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 11.5% this year versus the industry average of 0%.
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Banco Itau. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.3% over the past month.
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Banco Itau a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.
