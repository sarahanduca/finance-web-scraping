/news/walt-disney-started-outperform-bernstein-055654422.html,Walt Disney started with Outperform at Bernstein: 4 big analyst picks,"Investing.com — Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst picks you may have missed since yesterday: an Outperform initiation at Walt Disney , and upgrades at Vale, Shoals Technologies Group , and TE Connectivity.
Bernstein initiated coverage on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $103.00.
The firm is optimistic about Disney's potential to transition to direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming successfully once combined with Hulu.
We forecast DTC growth to outpace Linear decline, supporting overall growth of Media, with DTC revenue surpassing Linear revenue in 2024, and Disney becoming the undisputed #2 SVOD.
The firm foresees EBITDA margin expansion from around 18% to the low 20s for the foreseeable future. “Hulu is a near-term controversy due to the uncertainty about how much Disney will end up paying for CMCSA's 1/3 stake in Hulu, but we believe the range of outcomes is narrow,” commented Bernstein. According to the firm, Disney stands to benefit significantly from full control of the asset, and if the deal is resolved positively, it could lift a modest overhang on the stock.
According to the bank, the commodities and mining sector's outlook is balanced due to China's efforts to support its economy and the offsetting effects of property market weakness with strength in infrastructure and other sectors.
According to UBS, the key driver for Vale is the iron ore price, which is expected to remain within the range of $100-130 per ton over the next six months. This allows Vale to offer an attractive dividend of approximately $4.6 billion (approximately 8% yield) over the next year and buy back stock.
Shoals Technologies Group (NASDAQ:SHLS) shares gained more than 4% pre-market today after Piper Sandler upgraded the company to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $28.00.
TE Connectivity (NYSE:TEL) shares rose more than 1% pre-market today after TD Cowen upgraded the company to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $140.00.

Shares of the company have depreciated by 7.2% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Basic Materials sector's loss of 7.36% and lagging the S&P 500's loss of 6.19%.
Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of VALE S.A. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect VALE S.A. to post earnings of $0.71 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 27.55%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $11.23 billion, up 13.09% from the prior-year quarter.
For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.05 per share and a revenue of $41.01 billion, representing changes of -43.21% and -6.45%, respectively, from the prior year.
Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for VALE S.A. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Our research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 6.63% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, VALE S.A. boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Investors should also note VALE S.A.'s current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 6.28. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 7.34.
The Mining - Iron industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 6, which puts it in the top 3% of all 250+ industries.

/news/wall-street-analysts-think-vale-135504864.html,Wall Street Analysts Think VALE S.A. (VALE) Could Surge 29.02%: Read This Before Placing a Bet,"VALE S.A. (VALE) closed the last trading session at $13.23, gaining 0.5% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $17.07 indicates a 29% upside potential.
The mean estimate comprises 10 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $2.13. While the lowest estimate of $13.20 indicates a 0.2% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 51.2% to reach $20. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.
While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.
But, for VALE, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.
Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets
According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.
While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?
They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.
However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.
That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.
Why VALE Could Witness a Solid Upside
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.5%, as two estimates have moved higher while one has gone lower.
Moreover, VALE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much VALE could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.",2023-09-29,0.10272122898746276,0.49922513633552584

/news/vale-vale-port-acu-build-152900575.html,Vale (VALE) & Port of Acu to Build Low-Carbon Iron Ore Complex,"Vale S.A. VALE has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Port of Açu to explore the possibility of the development of a Mega Hub as part of its decarbonization efforts. The Mega Hub will include a plant, which will produce hot briquetted iron (HBI) using the direct reduction route. This is a groundbreaking initiative as it is expected to produce HBI with near-zero carbon emission.
The Port of Açu, located in the northern region of Rio de Janeiro, is the largest deep-sea port complex in Latin America. The port authorities have been focused on low-carbon projects in order to be recognized as the energy transition port of Brazil.
HBI is considered as an important intermediate steel product to reduce harmful emissions as it eliminates the need to use dirty coke or coal in steel manufacturing. Currently, HBI is mostly used in electric arc furnaces. A technical study will be coordinated by the Port of Açu and researchers to explore the use of HBI as partial burden in blast-furnaces. This will help in lowering carbon dioxide emissions by about 25% (with even greater potential reductions along the supply chain) while increasing blast furnace productivity.Mega Hubs are industrial complexes designed to produce low-carbon steel products. Vale has announced plans to build such hubs in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Oman, with the first hub expected to go live in 2027.
The Mega Hub in Brazil, which will be developed with the Port of Acu, will initially receive pellets from Vale. In the future, it might include an iron ore briquette plant at site to supply the direct reduction route at the industrial complex. As per the agreement, both companies will look for investors to build and operate the Direct Reduction plant using natural gas, which will be available at the port, with the possibility of eventually converting to green hydrogen. This will help in producing HBI, thus ensuring near-zero carbon emissions.
This endeavor will open up the possibility of the development of further Mega Hubs in Brazil. It will largely contribute to the decarbonization of the domestic and international steel industry.
Shares of Vale have gained 4.4% in a year, in line with the industry.

/news/10-stocks-bounce-back-according-171412601.html,10 Stocks that Will Bounce Back According to Reddit,"US stock markets were wavering after latest inflation data showed pricing pressures are returning, albeit due to rising oil prices. Despite the ifs and buts, it’s clear that the Fed has not been able to get the results it wanted (so far) with its persistent rate hikes. Investors were too early to cheer the start of the bull market. The Fed could very well begin another set of rate hikes, and even if it holds back on rate hikes for now the first half of 2024 could be jittery for the stock market. But stock markets have always been like this; always moving on news cycles and investors always looking over their shoulder for that next important data point and report. If we zoom out, though, we will notice that stock markets tend to move upwards in the long run and investors who give up too early and sell based on news cycles end up losing most of those sweet gains.
“Even if I look at the United States with its 3500 some odd publicly traded businesses, an investment manager can really not drill down on more than a few dozen of them every year. So they have to make a decision relatively quickly on which ones they are or are not going to focus on. Commitment bias that comes in once we start spending time on something, our brains play games with us. One of the games our brain plays is that we feel entitled. “Hey, if I spent some time on it, I ought to make money on it”. And that’s really not how investing works. I think it’s very important to be aware of commitment bias, and to be very aware that the first two or three minutes that when you’re looking at a company are when you have to make the call. It’s okay to let a winner go, but more important not to let a loser stay.”

In this article we scoured several Reddit subreddits like Investing, StockMarket, Stocks, Wall Street Bets, among others, to see which stocks Redditors believe will rebound from their lows in the future. We picked only those stocks that are down year to date or over the past 12 months with a positive sentiment on Reddit. Redditors either believe these companies are undervalued or the selloff around them is overdone. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors around each stock.

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) shares have lost about 40% over the past one year. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) is one of the top lithium stocks loved by Redditors and many on the platform believe the stock is offering a good entry point for the long term.
Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) is currently on investors’ radar after reports said an estimated 20 to 40 million tonnes of lithium reserves are found near the company’s Thacker Pass project.
As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 12 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC).
“During the first quarter, Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) had several positive events, including a favorable record of decision ruling for Thacker Pass, paving the way for construction of the mine to start, a revised Thacker resource/cost estimates, and GM’s financing/offtake agreement. Even though LAC is non-producing and its stock is down 34% over the past year (compared to the larger lithium producer’s 3%), the stock remains one of our favorites with multiple catalysts (and still up roughly 600% from our initial purchase price):

Clothing company Levi Strauss shares fell sharply in July after the company cut its FY23 revenue growth guidance range and also decreased its FY23 profit guidance by 15%.
In the second quarter, Levi Strauss's adjusted EPS came in at $0.04 beating estimates by $0.01.  Revenue in the period came in at $1.34 billion, meeting estimates.
LEVI has a PE ratio of 12.40 as of September 13. Levi’s is also a strong dividend payer, with an over 3% yield. Redditors believe the stock can rebound when inflation pressures subside and the consumer will have confidence and buying power to boost their spending.
“Driven by our ongoing execution in surgical pricing action U.S. wholesale will stabilize and end the year as a smaller share of our business at less than 30%. Inventories are expected to end 2023 below prior year levels. Our 2023 gross margin is expected to remain 300 basis points higher than 2019 and we will exit the year with Q4 EBIT margins north of 12%. And importantly, we continue to return cash to our shareholders with a payout ratio of 150% of free-cash flow substantially higher than our targeted 55% to 65% communicated at our Investor Day. Lastly, while we are lowering our H2 outlook because of U.S. wholesale, we expect the strong growth in our large fast growing DTC and international businesses to continue, which as U.S. wholesale stabilizes and COGS improves will position our unique business model to generate significant financial leverage beyond 2023.”

Metals and mining company Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)’s stock has lost about 16% year to date through September 13. Redditors believe Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) can rebound. One Redditor, for example, said in a stock discussion thread:
“Im waiting on VALE to catch a low. Its in the murky cross over of an up swing. Looking to hold for a few months for roughly a 25% gain. If it runs to what it did after covid, ~55%. I've got a buy limit order in, hopefully penny pinching doesn't hurt me while I'm gone on a week vacation.”
Earlier this month, J.P. Morgan upgraded Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) from Neutral. JPMorgan said the stock is undervalued when compared to its peers.
“Current iron ore prices are being supported by improved sentiment on China reopening and robust steel output. Current valuation looks discounted as the stock has de-rated, currently down 27.2% year-to-date, and has been outperformed by iron ore,” JPMorgan’s Rodolfo Angele said.
“Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world’s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any “unreasonable” price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year’s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company’s market cap.”
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45
Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shares are down about 16% year to date. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) suffered a backlash from customers earlier this year after it showcased LGBT merchandize at its stores. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) later moved this LGBT-focused merchandize from “the front of the stores to the back” in some stores.
In August Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) posted second quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.80 beating estimates by $0.38. Revenue in the period came in at $24.77 billion, missing estimates by $460 million.
As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).
“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”

Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) ranks 6th in our list of stocks that will bounce back according to Reddit. Recently, BMO Capital mentioned a list of stocks that have grown at a “reasonable price.” Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) was part of the list with an Outperform rating set by BMO.
As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 50 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH). The biggest stakeholder of Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $103 million stake in the company.
“Enphase Energy provides solar microinverters and energy storage solutions. The company’s shares lagged benchmark counterparts amid concerns surrounding a near-term moderation in the growth of residential solar installation in the United States. Despite this, the company possesses a market-leading position in its core microinverter product and remains wellpositioned over the long term to benefit from ongoing solar adoption trends. Additionally, Enphase is focused on growing its international presence while also unveiling new products that could provide the next tailwind to its growth story.”
