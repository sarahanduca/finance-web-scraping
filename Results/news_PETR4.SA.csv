/news/know-petrobras-pbr-rating-upgrade-160006948.html,All You Need to Know About Petrobras (PBR) Rating Upgrade to Strong Buy,"Petrobras (PBR) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.
Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Petrobras basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.
For Petrobras, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Petrobras
This oil and gas company is expected to earn $3.59 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of -32.1%.
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Petrobras. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10%.
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

/news/petroleo-brasileiro-petrobras-pbr-trending-130006655.html,Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras (PBR) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Petrobras (PBR) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Shares of this oil and gas company have returned -3.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.2% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - Emerging Markets industry, to which Petrobras belongs, has lost 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Petrobras is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share, indicating a change of -45.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -32.1%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.40 indicates a change of -5.4% from what Petrobras is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.3%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Petrobras is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Petrobras, the consensus sales estimate of $23.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -27%. The $97.18 billion and $101.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -21.9% and +4.2%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Petrobras reported revenues of $22.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.8%. EPS of $0.90 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.01%. The EPS surprise was -7.22%.
Over the last four quarters, Petrobras surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Petrobras is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line

/news/petrobras-pbr-vale-join-forces-111900906.html,Petrobras (PBR) & Vale Join Forces to Develop Renewable Energy,"Petrobras PBR, Brazil's state oil company, and Vale VALE, a prominent Brazilian mining company, have announced their plans to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to study potential joint ventures in renewable energy. The move comes as both companies are looking to reduce their carbon footprint and invest in new sources of energy.
The announcement is a testament to the dynamism and adaptability of the energy sector. As the global community lays increasing emphasis on reducing carbon footprint and achieving sustainability, both Petrobras and Vale recognize the need to diversify their operations and align with these global trends.
Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates has expressed his optimism regarding Vale's involvement in this arena. He believes that the company’s expertise can help Brazil take significant steps toward becoming a global leader in green hydrogen production. This could not only reduce the nation's carbon emissions but also boost its energy security in an increasingly volatile world.
One of the key areas of interest in this collaboration is hydrogen production. Hydrogen, often referred to as the ""fuel of the future"", holds immense potential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and powering a cleaner world. Vale, with its extensive experience in mining and resource extraction, is well-positioned to contribute to the development of efficient and sustainable hydrogen production.
Beyond hydrogen production, Petrobras and Vale are eyeing a broader portfolio of energy transition initiatives. This includes investments in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. The collaboration seeks to harness Brazil's vast natural resources and transform them into clean, reliable and sustainable energy solutions.
In addition to its ambitions in renewable energy, Petrobras faces a pressing challenge in the form of diesel fuel supply. The recent bans on diesel imports from Russia, Brazil's primary source of imported diesel, have necessitated a strategic reassessment.
With these disrupted diesel imports, PBR is exploring alternative sources to meet the domestic demand for diesel. This situation has opened the door to potential imports from other nations that may offer a more stable and reliable supply chain.
Prates acknowledges the importance of securing a consistent diesel supply for Brazil’s energy needs. However, he remains confident that Petrobras can adapt to these changes while maintaining its profitability.
The widening gap between Brazil's refinery prices and international rates, driven by fluctuations in oil prices, poses a unique challenge. Despite these market dynamics, PBR remains committed to offering competitive pricing models. The company's ability to navigate these price disparities without compromising profitability showcases its resilience and dedication to serving Brazil’s market.
The impending MOU between Petrobras and Vale marks a pivotal moment in the country’s energy sector. As these industry giants join forces to explore renewable energy sources and hydrogen production, they are poised to contribute significantly to a cleaner, more sustainable future. Petrobras' adaptability in the face of diesel supply challenges underscores its commitment to meeting Brazil’s energy needs.

This contract, valued between $75 million and $250 million, highlights TechnipFMC's capability to design, engineer, and manufacture 14 kilometers of gas injection riser pipes, along with providing associated services such as packing and storage. These flexible pipes are essential for transporting oil and gas from offshore fields to the surface. They are also used for gas injection, which helps to improve oil recovery.
Understanding the Pre-Salt Fields: Before we delve deeper into the project, let's take a moment to understand the significance of the pre-salt fields offshore Brazil. These reserves are located beneath a thick layer of salt deep below the ocean's surface. Extracting oil and gas from this challenging environment requires cutting-edge technology and expertise.
Brazil's Energy Potential: Brazil's pre-salt fields are a critical asset in the country's energy portfolio. They are estimated to hold vast reserves of oil and gas, making them a strategic resource for the nation's energy security and economic growth.
Design, Engineering, and Manufacturing: TechnipFMC's role in this project is multifaceted. They are tasked with designing, engineering, and manufacturing a total of 14 kilometers of gas injection riser pipes. This involves intricate planning, cutting-edge technology, and an unparalleled commitment to precision.
Beyond the Pipes: The project scope extends beyond the physical pipes. TechnipFMC will also provide essential associated services, including packing and storage. This comprehensive approach ensures that Petrobras receives not only top-quality products but also the necessary support to ensure project success.
Flexible pipes are particularly well-suited for use in the pre-salt fields for a number of reasons. First, they are able to withstand the high pressures and temperatures that are found in these fields. Second, they are flexible and can be easily installed in complex subsea environments. Third, they have a long service life and require minimal maintenance.
The pre-salt fields, located deep beneath the ocean floor, are known for their impressive productivity but present unique challenges due to their extraordinary depth and complexity. TechnipFMC's engagement in developing these fields is not a recent work, they have a commendable history of collaboration with Petrobras on various significant projects in the region, including the Buzios and Mero fields. This latest contract reaffirms Petrobras' unwavering trust in TechnipFMC's expertise and their ability to deliver top-notch products and services, further cementing their strong foothold in the Brazilian oil and gas market.
The award of this contract to TechnipFMC is a significant development for the Company. It strengthens its position as a leading supplier of flexible pipes to the Brazilian oil and gas industry, and it is a testament to the Company's expertise in this field.

/news/petrobras-pbr-secures-permit-drill-132700171.html,Petrobras (PBR) Secures Permit to Drill in Potiguar Basin,"Petrobras PBR, Brazil's state-controlled oil company, received an environmental license from Brazil's top environmental agency, Ibama, to explore the promising Potiguar Basin. This long-awaited permit covers the way for Petrobras to expand its oil production operations by tapping into new offshore basins in the country's northeast.
Let’s delve into the details of this achievement, its implications for Petrobras and Brazil's energy landscape, and the potential economic and environmental impacts.
Petrobras will initiate drilling activities in the Potiguar Basin next month, once the necessary drilling rig arrives at the location. The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive survey of the area, assessing both its economic viability and the extent of the oil discovery initially made in 2013 at the Pitu well. It's essential to note that, as of now, there is no oil production in this region.
The environmental license from Ibama marks a turning point for Petrobras, as it anticipates the official notice to proceed with drilling activities at two exploratory wells in the maritime block BM-POT-17, situated in the deep waters of the Potiguar Basin. The first of these wells will be drilled approximately 52 kilometers (32 miles) off the Brazilian coast. Petrobras has taken proactive measures by simulating a response to a potential oil spill earlier this month, emphasizing its commitment to environmental safety.
PBR views the Equatorial Margin as another crucial area for future oil exploration in Brazil, potentially holding reserves on par with the multibillion-barrel discoveries being made by ExxonMobil Corp. XOM in North Guyana. This perspective highlights the strategic importance of the Potiguar Basin and the broader Equatorial Margin.
Earlier this year, Petrobras faced setbacks when Ibama blocked its plans to commence drilling in block FZA-M-59, located in the potentially oil-rich region within the Foz do Amazonas basin. This decision stemmed from social and environmental concerns. In response, Petrobras decided to apply for a license to drill in the Potiguar Basin as an alternative strategy while awaiting Ibama's analysis of an appeal regarding block FZA-M-59.
Following the approval to explore the Potiguar Basin, Petrobras anticipates making significant strides in studying the necessary conditions for research in the Foz do Amazonas basin. According to minister Alexandre Silveira, Petrobras' studies indicate that block FZA-M-59 alone may hold an astounding 5.6 billion barrels of oil. This highlights the immense hydrocarbon potential of this region, which, if harnessed responsibly, could play a key role in Brazil's energy security and economic development.
As the country seeks to increase its oil production, it must also align with the global climate agendas. It is on track to reach record oil output this year. However, the initiative to survey the Potiguar Basin has not been without controversy. Environmental activists voiced their concerns, and tensions have arisen among president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's allies.
Silveira remains optimistic, stating that once the exploration potential is confirmed, the region will witness enhanced social and economic development, with additional resources available for healthcare and education. Petrobras also emphasizes the importance of Brazil's new frontiers in ensuring national energy security and sovereignty, particularly in the context of energy transition and a low-carbon economy.
Petrobras' receipt of the environmental license to explore the Potiguar Basin signifies a significant step forward in Brazil's quest to expand its oil production capabilities. This attempt aligns with the company’s strategic vision for the Equatorial Margin, offering the potential for substantial hydrocarbon reserves.
Only time will reveal the true potential of the Potiguar Basin and its impact on Brazil's energy landscape. For now, this milestone marks a pivotal moment in the nation's journey toward energy security and economic growth.
